# University Management System (C++)

A console-based University Management System developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
This project demonstrates modular system design, structured data management, and user authentication functionality.

## 🚀 Features

- User Login Authentication System
- Student Record Management
- Course Management Module
- Faculty/Administrative Data Handling
- File Handling for Persistent Data Storage
- Modular and Structured Code Architecture

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Applied

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

## 🔐 Authentication System

The system includes a login mechanism to ensure controlled access and simulate real-world application security.

## 📂 Project Structure

- Separate classes for students, courses, and administration
- Organized functions for data manipulation
- Persistent storage using file handling

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Strengthened understanding of system modeling using OOP
- Improved code modularity and maintainability
- Practical implementation of authentication logic
- Enhanced problem-solving and structured programming skills
